# ExecRay Tracer Demo Scripts

This directory contains comprehensive demonstration scripts for showcasing ExecRay Tracer's capabilities to hackathon judges and technical evaluators.

## Demo Scripts Overview

### 🚀 Quick Evaluation Scripts

#### `quick_judge_demo.sh` (2 minutes)
**Purpose**: Rapid validation for busy judges
- Build verification and core functionality test
- DSL compilation demonstration
- Policy engine startup validation
- **Use Case**: Initial screening, time-constrained evaluation

```bash
# Run 2-minute validation
./demo_scripts/quick_judge_demo.sh
```

### 🎯 Comprehensive Demonstrations

#### `complete_demo.sh` (15-20 minutes)
**Purpose**: Full system showcase with all features
- Complete system validation (build + tests)
- DSL compiler pipeline (lexer → parser → AST → FSM)
- Real-time policy engine with live compilation
- Threat detection scenarios with simulated attacks
- Performance benchmarking
- Hot-reload capabilities demonstration

```bash
# Run comprehensive demonstration
./demo_scripts/complete_demo.sh
```

### ⚡ Performance Analysis

#### `performance_benchmark.sh` (10-15 minutes)
**Purpose**: Quantitative performance evaluation
- Compilation speed benchmarks (DSL → FSM)
- Execution latency measurements (event processing)
- Memory usage analysis (scaling with policy count)
- Throughput testing (sustained event processing rate)
- Comparative performance metrics vs. alternatives

```bash
# Run performance benchmarks
./demo_scripts/performance_benchmark.sh
```

**Expected Results:**
- Policy compilation: ~248μs per policy
- FSM execution: ~758ns per event
- Detection latency: <5ms average
- Memory usage: <50MB for 100 policies
- Throughput: 10,000+ events/second

### 🛡️ Threat Detection Showcase

#### `threat_detection_showcase.sh` (10-12 minutes)
**Purpose**: Real-world attack pattern detection
- **6 Attack Scenarios**: Privilege escalation, data exfiltration, reverse shell, keylogger, APT, container escape
- **Live Detection**: Real-time pattern matching with FSM execution
- **Multi-step Patterns**: Complex attack sequences across multiple syscalls
- **Policy Correlation**: Shows how DSL policies map to actual threat behaviors

```bash
# Run threat detection demonstration
./demo_scripts/threat_detection_showcase.sh
```

**Attack Scenarios Covered:**
1. **Privilege Escalation**: `/etc/passwd` access → root modification → shell execution
2. **Data Exfiltration**: Private key access → archiving → network transmission
3. **Reverse Shell**: Payload creation → shell redirection → network tools
4. **Keylogger**: Input device access → keystroke logging → credential capture
5. **APT Backdoor**: Persistence establishment → C2 communication → lateral movement
6. **Container Escape**: Runtime access → host mount → namespace escape

### 🔄 Hot Reload Demonstration

#### `hotreload_demo.sh` (8-10 minutes)
**Purpose**: Dynamic policy updates without restart
- **Runtime Policy Addition**: Add new threat detection during operation
- **Policy Modification**: Update existing policies with zero downtime
- **Complex Conditional Logic**: Hot-load multi-step conditional policies
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid policy syntax
- **State Preservation**: Maintain system state during policy changes

```bash
# Run hot reload demonstration
./demo_scripts/hotreload_demo.sh
```

**Hot Reload Phases:**
1. Initial policy loading and operation
2. Runtime policy addition (new threat detection)
3. Existing policy modification (enhanced logic)
4. Complex conditional policy loading
5. Policy removal during operation
6. Error handling and recovery

## Judge Evaluation Workflow

### For Time-Constrained Evaluation (2-5 minutes)
```bash
# Quick validation of core functionality
./demo_scripts/quick_judge_demo.sh
```

### For Detailed Technical Review (15-30 minutes)
```bash
# Complete system demonstration
./demo_scripts/complete_demo.sh

# Optional: Specific capability deep-dives
./demo_scripts/performance_benchmark.sh
./demo_scripts/threat_detection_showcase.sh
./demo_scripts/hotreload_demo.sh
```

### For Live Interactive Demo
```bash
# Start policy engine for live interaction
go run cmd/policyd_demo/main.go

# In another terminal, create custom policies:
vim policies/judge_custom.policy

# Test individual components:
go run cmd/lexer_example/main.go 'path "test" { openat { pathname =~ "/judge/test" } }'
go run cmd/parser_example/main.go 'path "test" { execve { filename =~ "/bin/demo" } }'
```
